# Portfolio - Fitzwinick

The objective of this site is to dislay projects I that I have worked on the full stack (front and back). This link includes an "About Me" page, a "Portfolio" page and a "Contact" page.

## File Structure

The index.html is a file that is linked to both a style sheet (asssets/css/style.css) and two sub html indices, named contactindex.html and portfolioindex.html. They are also linked to the included image files. I also provided a Bootstrap link in the header in order to utilize the sites content and templates. For alternate viewports, a viewport meta tag is included on the html page.

For data base management, there is a user model file defining the schema. For backend, a server has been created to listen on a port.
