# Responsiveness-Portfolio

The objective of this project was to create my first portfolio.   This includes an "About Me" page, a "Portfolio" page and a "Contact" page.  

# How to Access the Work

I will be supplying a url to the project along with a git hub url.

# Things needed to view

The index.html is a file that is linked to both a style sheet (asssets/css/style.css) and two sub html indices, named contactindex.html and portfolioindex.html.  They are also linked to the included image files.  I also provided a Bootstrap link in the header in order to utilize the sites content and templates.   For alternate viewports, a viewport meta tag is included on the html page.

# Challenges and Observations

I really enjoyed building out this site. I used Bootstrap to build out my containers, rows and columns.  I also used their form template for my contact page, but I modified it.  I also used their nav bundle, but I deleted some of the list items.

# Content Provided

The images were either self photos or screen grabs from google images.  The text content will be updated from lorem to actual text content in subsequent revisions.  The screen grab thumbnails on the portfolio page will be replaced with new content in subsequent revisions also.


# Acknowledgments
