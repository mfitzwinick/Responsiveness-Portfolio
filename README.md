# Portfolio - Fitzwinick

The objective of this site is to dislay projects I that I have worked on the full stack (front and back). This link includes an "About Me" page, a "Portfolio" page and a "Contact" page.  



## File Structure

The index.html is a file that is linked to both a style sheet (asssets/css/style.css) and two sub html indices, named contactindex.html and portfolioindex.html.  They are also linked to the included image files.  I also provided a Bootstrap link in the header in order to utilize the sites content and templates.   For alternate viewports, a viewport meta tag is included on the html page.

## Languages
